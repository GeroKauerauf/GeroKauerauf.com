My name is Gero Kauerauf.
I am a computer science student based in Aachen, Germany.
I study at RWTH Aachen University and am currently enrolled in my master's.
During the course of my degree I specialize in computational science with an eye on combinatorial optimization and algorithmic differentiation.

On this website I will most likely share my projects & thoughts on various topics.

This website is build with

and
<a href="https://github.com/poole/poole" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poole</a>
using the (slightly modified)

theme.
